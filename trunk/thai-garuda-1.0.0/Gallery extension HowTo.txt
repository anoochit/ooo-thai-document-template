HOW TO CREATE AN EXTENSION THAT INCLUDES A NEW CLIPART GALLERY THEME

1.) Build a new theme in your OOo Gallery (displayed via 
    "Tools" - "Gallery") and name it appropriately.

2.)Add the clipart you want to include in this theme from a Draw 
    document (click on an image for more than 2 seconds, then drag and 
    drop it to the gallery area). 
    Adding clipart from your file system to the second tab of the 
    gallery theme's properities will create links instead of embedding
    the files, drag&drop from Writer will link to your local 
    /user/gallery/dragdrop folder.
    If you want to, you may sort them afterwards.

3.) Copy the newly created gallery files (sg<nr>.sdg, sg<nr>.sdv,
    sg<nr>.thm) from your application's gallery folder 
    (...openoffice.org/3/user/gallery/) to the gallery/ folder of this 
    extension (extracting it beforehand might be a good idea...).

4.) Edit the description.xml file and adapt it to your needs:
    - version (mandatory)
    - identifier (mandatory for updates - if you don't add it, it will 
      be added by the extension manager)
    - extension name (mandatory)
    - icon (optional): Shows up in the extension manager
    - license (optional): If you want the user/admin to accept the 
      license, uncomment the paragraph <registration> and put the 
      license text in resources/ (file name: license_en.txt).
      Otherwise it would be sufficient to include the license in the 
      extension.
      (If you want to use PDL, edit license_PDL.txt and adapt 
         - TITLE OF THE EXTENSION
         - PRENAME NAME
         - YEAR
         - EMAIL@ADDRESS
      If not, remove this file, use license_LGPL.txt or add the license
      of your choice - multiple licenses are possible too)

5.) Edit the description file in description/description_en.txt
    This text shows up in the extension manager.
    If you don't want to add a description, remove/comment the paragraph
    <extension-description> in description.xls.

6.) Compress the extension again (to .zip) and rename it to .oxt.

7.) Test your new extension in a version of OpenOffice.org that doesn't 
    contain the gallery theme. You might close the application 
    (including the Quickstarter, if active) to update the gallery.

8.) If the extension works as supposed, feel free to share it with 
    others: 
    - Upload it to http://extensions.openoffice.org.
    - Create an overview image of the extension's content.
    - Add a link to the extension and a thumbnail of your overview to
      http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/Art/Gallery/Clipart
